# Customer Segmentation Using AI and ML

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI and ML-based customer segmentation model to enhance marketing strategies for businesses. By leveraging clustering algorithms and machine learning techniques, we can classify customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and characteristics.

## Features
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Implementation of Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Insights and Actionable Strategies for Businesses
- Data Visualization for Better Interpretation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Algorithms)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- OpenCV, MediaPipe (if applicable for visualization)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses a hypothetical dataset consisting of:
- Demographic Data (Age, Gender, Income, etc.)
- Transaction Data (Purchase Frequency, Amount Spent, etc.)
- Behavioral Data (Browsing Patterns, Engagement, etc.)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Calinski-Harabasz Index

## Results & Insights
- Identify high-value customers
- Optimize marketing strategies based on segments
- Improve customer satisfaction through personalized targeting

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time segmentation
- Integrate with marketing automation tools
- Explore deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy
